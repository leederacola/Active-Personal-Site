        Currently I am working on an Angular 6 app that will allow users (me and my friends) to plan our board game nights.  Current work in progress hosted with Google Firebase and using Google Firebase Real-Time Database.
        I have started a .NET Core MVC project for admin db things and API controllers for Angular site to consume.  Mostly becasue ya'll want SQL and I need to show I know SQL.
